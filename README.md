# Iris Red Team Apps Repo

Holds the app that the iris red team deploys in the [tmc flux multitenant](https://github.com/warroyo/flux-tmc-multitenant) example.

Typically this repo would hold the code of an application. becuase this is a simplified example we are using a pre-buitl app. so this only contains the k8s config to deploy it.
